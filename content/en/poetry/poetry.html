<p>I would categorize my personal style as somewhere between <em>derivative</em> and <em>cringe</em>.  Of course, I&rsquo;m open to all sorts of feedback.</p>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; August 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A giant in the shoes of a man<br>
A god wrapped in a mortal&rsquo;s pelt<br>
A beggar assuming a rich man&rsquo;s svelte<br>
A one-trick pony who wows again.</p>
<p>All those they rose under a cool twilight eve<br>
With friends and unknowns alike<br>
A savory potluck among salty waves reaching<br>
Ever closer, &lsquo;neath the call of soft moonlight.</p>
<p>But from the water&rsquo;s flesh, soggy cripples emerged<br>
Each more grotesque than the last<br>
Until the bastard crew&rsquo;s final lizard<br>
Crawled out, terrorizing the virgin grass.</p>
<p>   « <em>Oh!  How he howled like a pig<br>
   all mixed up in his own blood<br>
   and his own foul slime!</em> »</p>
<p>The giant, at this he slouched<br>
The god took years on his shoulders<br>
The beggar sat and wept, his appetite lost<br>
The lame pony spooked off, driven mad by the odours.</p>
<p>Those hogs slabbered with haste, as if at the trough<br>
Sweet death had complied with their final demand<br>
All noble spirits on the shore had crumpled<br>
For heavy are the souls of the damned.</p>

<p><em>Crossing your path</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to cross your path from time to time<br>
To say &lsquo;Hello&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Goodbye&rsquo;<br>
And leave a little tune behind<br>
— That once we knew by heart<br>
Now worn with time —<br>
To hum that song of ours.</p>
<p>Oh, hum that song of ours<br>
Remind me how it goes, I&rsquo;ve lost the rhyme.<br>
While some day soon or far<br>
You&rsquo;ll sing a song I&rsquo;ve never heard before<br>
It&rsquo;ll drive me mad, convinced I know the words<br>
And how it ends, from hook to final verse.</p>
<p>But if that soon or far appears<br>
Tomorrow or Today<br>
Not sure how read&rsquo;ly I&rsquo;d admit<br>
Your verse with him struck something new<br>
And better than the one we wrote<br>
Just for me and you.</p>

<p><em>Untitled pt. 2</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>

<p>and the end it was so brief half an hour in the park and we didnt even break open the pulco and sparkling water</p>
<p>she was calm as was i there was maybe a single moment where a tear was held back</p>
<p>oh isnt it complicated to close the book of belle hectic mornings and pale razorburnt legs out in the world lovely lovely and probably crying brutally alone in her bed as i write this</p>
<p>sleep will come easier as i read it back each night knowing with each recitation ill fade further onto her horizon.</p>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If ever a lonely night<br>
Should you wake in a sharp tremor<br>
From a passing specter&rsquo;s strike<br>
Whose trailing vapors leak a sweet scent<br>
That only you and I could recognize&hellip;</p>
<p>Écrase-le !<br>
Et moi je vais faire pareil<br>
Il n&rsquo;est rien qu&rsquo;un moustique qui vit de l&rsquo;obscurité<br>
Un porte-souvenir des nuits si chauds<br>
Et ses piqûres guériront par l&rsquo;aube du lendemain</p>
<p>Même si l&rsquo;odeur persiste toujours<br>
Cet odeur dont l&rsquo;existence le matin<br>
révèle que ce rêve<br>
Ne vivait pas que dans ta tête<br>
Ni que pendant la nuit</p>

<p><em>Whalebone branches</em> &ndash; June 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whalebone branches<br>
they bellow and spill<br>
leaves torn from their bindings<br>
onto all the stand-buyers<br>
in the widening gyre.</p>
<p>Those urchins from Ur<br>
with their babbling burns<br>
each scar submits a solution<br>
&ldquo;Not a 5-over-1, it&rsquo;s just so overdone.&rdquo;<br>
A sober flight takes thought<br>
with a rabid Star Fox<br>
whose atavistic impulses<br>
barrel-roll to steal the old<br>
from the Niagara Cafe.</p>
<p>And maybe in its depths<br>
he&rsquo;ll ask directions<br>
from the Maidens of Mist.<br>
They&rsquo;ll turn tablets to clay<br>
declare &ldquo;La vie est une scie&rdquo;<br>
buy a round for all<br>
the hypocrites of twenty twenty-three.</p>
<p>Silver tongues will take a lick,<br>
restore our faith in Moby Dick,<br>
find ourselves like that Tarkovsky flick,<br>
till no warm-blooded carcass persists.</p>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; May 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accro à la banalité<br>
A la recherche d&rsquo;une bière<br>
Tellement de temps bu<br>
Sans rien faire<br>
Chasseurs des pique-niques<br>
Cuites au soleil<br>
Brillants sommes nous<br>
Les lapins d&rsquo;été</p>

<p><em>Those oozing stacks grow</em> &ndash; April 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to tell of carcasses stacked tall<br>
Of honey dried out at crusty summer&rsquo;s fall<br>
That bridge appeared and beckoned passers-by<br>
To give the yonder ravine&rsquo;s edge a try.</p>
<p>So you and her, cutting through the weeds —<br>
Trudged, creaking, above the misty deeps<br>
In search of fire to warm your tender skin<br>
or adventure&rsquo;s strike to bake you from within.<br>
But an hour&rsquo;s passed and still ye edge along<br>
uncertain heartbeats pound a booming song.</p>
<p>All while we howl and screech out for you<br>
&ldquo;Oh lovelies, you&rsquo;ve never seen splendors more true<br>
than that which awaits all who cross the border<br>
and abides by our master&rsquo;s all-knowing order&rdquo;<br>
Put candidly, just once, for the hatchlings to our realm<br>
Take a dive, be immersed, as a feather to inkwell.</p>
<p>You smirked and wrote verse, your spirits were high<br>
Eager for the taverns where they&rsquo;ll chant your hero&rsquo;s cry<br>
And so ye arrive, dock on our shores<br>
waves hit with sting, mixing afters and befores<br>
Drowning on the cliff, you hold each other tight<br>
Swords drawn, side by side, ready for the fight&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Excuse me, dear listener,<br>
I&rsquo;ll divulge nothing more.<br>
Our master<br>
would rather<br>
cast shadows<br>
than lore.</p>
<p>I promised sick tales of flesh piled high<br>
but suffice it to know<br>
those oozing stacks grow<br>
with each ripe passerby.</p>

<p><em>Bruges Pluie Blues</em> &ndash; March 2023</p>

Qui connaissent Bruges d&rsquo;un film</p>

<p><em>Empanadas and Coffee</em> &ndash; February 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So there we were<br>
in the Halles of Wazemmes at noon on a Sunday<br>
eating empanadas and drinking coffee.<br>
It felt right.<br>
Smelled right.<br>
Tasted right.<br>
We could&rsquo;ve just as easily been<br>
in the &ldquo;halles&rdquo; of Ukrop&rsquo;s<br>
7:30 on a Tuesday morning<br>
eating biscuits and drinking chocolate milk<br>
me, Kevin, and Mom.<br>
It resonated.</p>
<p>It was just a few days later<br>
after a long moment<br>
squirming and panting,<br>
she tells me<br>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m falling in love.&rdquo;<br>
I didn&rsquo;t say anything back.<br>
Instead I let that hollow static<br>
build up between us<br>
My fingertips charged it,<br>
brushing up and down her spine.<br>
I can leave her there, knowing<br>
we just shared each other,<br>
So coherent, so resonant,<br>
And yet maybe nothing more will come of it.</p>
<p>But take birds — their songs come proud and natural<br>
one to another.<br>
But us humans, lonely savages staggering about,<br>
grasping blindly in the dark.<br>
Diffident beasts afraid to flick on the lights.<br>
At this rate we&rsquo;ll never sip that milk and honey.<br>
Those empanadas and coffee, even,<br>
so often evaporate to<br>
odours lingering and then eroding<br>
in a harsh wind<br>
that&rsquo;ll clear out by dusk</p>
<p>And by night&rsquo;s fall, we&rsquo;re back in our caves.<br>
Exhausted.<br>
Just trying to strike a fire.<br>
This time,<br>
one that&rsquo;ll last beyond morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Untitled night</em> &ndash; February 2023</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her animal lay wild,<br>
hunched, and prowling in its cage<br>
with iron bars made brittle by<br>
the advance of our seduction.<br>
Then one day she pounced and bared<br>
— Breathing with her whole body like an organ.<br>
An affront to what I used to know as &ldquo;passion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At once the wilderness subsided<br>
and we both froze then melted.<br>
She stepped fully into me,<br>
hesitation revealed to be<br>
footprints parting in the sand<br>
as evening tide approaches.<br>
— Call it a kind of destiny<br>
we&rsquo;d read between the waves.</p>
<p>So I gave myself relentlessly,<br>
inspired by that ferocity<br>
eager claws know well to be<br>
lurking beneath the dirt.<br>
And finally, when she drew blood,<br>
evinced our last temptation<br>
— We shared her gristle-ridden lair<br>
fused together, cast in crimson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kansas Sky</em> &ndash; July 2022</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.<br>
Once suspended in the Kansas sky<br>
   now turned to vapor in my eye.<br>
The eye which held a twinkle last night<br>
Not from a star, but a lightning strike.<br>
And here I gaze at Julie next to me <br>
   She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Like jackals, lips slippery</em> &ndash; May 2022</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackal toes and bloody lips<br>
On the wall trickles and drips<br>
Slips then slows to a crawl<br>
Let it all congeal.</p>
<p>The rabbit&rsquo;s jellied members<br>
Cousins found in burnt-up embers<br>
Whether or not they come around<br>
That hound still shrieks.</p>
<p>Festered paste birthed in mildew<br>
Rancid stir of pustules brew<br>
We the few who slurp that liqueur<br>
While her dusty lips moan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fierce creature</em> &ndash; January 2020</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fierce creature.<br>
Her warm-armed currents<br>
Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.<br>
Pulsing violent,<br>
Spewing caustic, emptying<br>
Into basins which steam future desire,<br>
Filled to quench days spent apart.</p>
